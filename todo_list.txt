Problem:
LSTM or 3D ConvNet will not work if the frames have multiple faces stacked on top of each other or if a non-face is detected as a face and stacked in with the faces. The pattern determined will not make sense because frames of different faces will be in sequence with each other.

Solution:
only a single face can be kept for the model

Ideas for fixing model
- keep only the largest face
    - need to run experiments to see if this will result in incorrect objects being matched with faces
    - will result in only one face being kept in each frame
- identify the size of a face (maybe the largest) keep only objects in future frames that match this size (within some tolerance)
- Use the entire frame (should run a baseline on this)
- should experiment with dlib, see if it performs better

If can reliably only grab faces, then multiple faces may be able to be kept with padded_batch

Tasks for this weekend
- get a baseline model trained on full frames
- test out dlib
